## Overview

This project aims to create a chatbot using Python that can understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot will be designed to handle predefined intents and respond appropriately based on the user's input.

### Key Components

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset containing predefined intents and associated patterns is loaded from a JSON file.
   - Data preprocessing involves tokenization, lemmatization, and preparation for training.

2. **Neural Network Model Construction**:
   - Keras is used to build a feedforward neural network model for intent classification.
   - The model architecture consists of dense layers with ReLU activation functions and dropout layers for regularization.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained using the prepared dataset, optimizing parameters to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - Training involves multiple epochs and evaluation based on accuracy metrics.

4. **Saving the Model**:
   - Once trained, the model is saved along with vocabulary and intent labels using pickle serialization.

### Expected Outcome

- A functional chatbot capable of understanding user queries and providing appropriate responses based on predefined intents.
- Potential for further improvement through fine-tuning, optimization, and integration with advanced NLP techniques.

### Applications

- Integration into websites, messaging apps, or customer service portals for automated assistance and FAQs handling.

### Skills Developed

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Neural Network Modeling
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Serialization and Persistence

### Technologies Used
